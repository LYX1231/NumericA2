# NumericA2
In this assignment you will demonstrate your understanding of solving engineering problems using numerical computations and assessing particular algorithms. The objectives of this assignment are to program algorithms for root-Ô¨Ånding, solving systems of linear algebraic equations, performing least-squares approximations and interpolations, regressing solutions and solving a differential equation using different integration and differentiation schemes.
